Coursework for my 2nd year computer science unit at the University of Bristol for which I received a grade of 75%. Both 
the final report and the code is included in this repository. My primary contributions to the final report were the sections
focusing on:
- Feature Selection
- Identifying the classes
- Nearest centroid classification
- Evaluation of result and classification methods
